label: Stimulus size is bigger than the window dimensions

synopsis: |
  Your stimulus size exceeds the X or Y window dimensions. Stimuli sized greater than the window size will not be completely visible.

details: |
  This issue is often caused by an inconsistency betwen the units of your stimulus and the values being requested. For instance a size of 3, when the units are `deg` is sensible (3 degrees would be within the screen dimensions) but a size of 3 when the units are `height` would not be sensible (3 times bigger than the height of the screen).

solutions: |
  Check the size and the :ref:`units of the stimulus <units>`_ carefully. You may also need to check the monitor calibration if you're using units that depend on the monitor size and resolution (like `cm` and `deg`).
