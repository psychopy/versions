msg: Your stimulus position exceeds the {dimension} dimension of your window.

label: Stimulus position is beyond the bounds of the window

synopsis: |  
  Your stimulus position exceeds the X or Y window dimensions. Stimuli centered beyond the window will not be completely visible.

details: |
  This issue is often caused by an inconsistency between the units of your stimulus and the values being requested. For instance a position of (3, 0), when the units are `deg` is sensible (3 degrees to the right of the screen center) but a position of (3, 0) when the units are `height` would not be sensible (3 times the height of the screen to the right of the center).

solutions: |
  Check the position and the :ref:`units of the stimulus <units>` carefully. You may also need to check the monitor calibration if you're using units that depend on the monitor size and resolution (like `cm` and `deg`).
