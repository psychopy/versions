label: Component start/stop in units of frames must be whole numbers

synopsis: |
  Component start and stop times/durations in frames must be given as whole numbers.

details: |
  Since it isn't possible to start or stop a stimulus part-way through a screen refresh it would be unwise to request that PsychoPy attempts that.

solutions: |
  Check your stimulus start/stop time and set to an integer value instead of a decimal value.
