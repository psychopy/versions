msg: Component {component} has stop time set as a duration, but doesn't have a start time

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Component stop duration with no start time

synopsis: |
  In order for stop time to be set as a duration, PsychoPy needs to know the time at which the component started. When there's no start time, stop time will be calculated from the duration as if start time were 0s.

details: |


solutions: |
  You can either add a start time to this component, or change the stop time to be set in a different way (e.g. `time (s)`)
