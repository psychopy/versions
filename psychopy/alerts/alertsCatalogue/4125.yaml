msg: Microphone component `{name}` given blank stop time, using max duration allowed by buffer size ({stopVal}s).

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Microphone component given blank stop time

synopsis: |
  Mircophone components can't record forever - there is a "buffer" with a finite size which will eventually fill up. As 
  you requested for a Microphone component to continue recording forever (by leaving the Stop field blank), PsychoPy 
  has substituted in the maximum time which you Microphone can record for, given the size of its buffer and the sample 
  rate it records at.

solutions: |
  No action is needed! Your Mircophone component will record for as long as it is able. To silence this alert, simply 
  give your Microphone component a duration.
