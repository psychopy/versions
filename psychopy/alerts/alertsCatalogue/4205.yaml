label: Probable syntax error detected in your Python code

synopsis: |
  Python syntax error found in your code component.

details: |
  This *may* be spurious in that the code check may have failed to understand something that is a valid syntax (syntax in Python can change according to version) but this will become clear if you run your experiment and it fails to run. 

solutions: |
  Check the code carefully at the indicated line and on the few lines above. Check especially for things like un-matched parentheses or quote symbols.

versions: |
  All versions.
