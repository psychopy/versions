msg: Your component is currently disabled and will not be written to your experiment script.

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Component is currently disabled in your experiment

synopsis: |
  You have a disabled Component in your experiment. This alert is created to inform users that
  disabled components will not be written to your experiment script. This may not be intentional,
  and will therefore affect your desired outcome.

details: |
  Most likely you disabled the Component deliberately while testing things out, but this Alert is making sure you remember that it isn't currently operational.

solutions: |
  Re-enable the Component in the Builder view (component dialog boxes each have a "testing" tab: unselect the "Disable component" setting there). Otherwise just ignore this Alert if you intended it to be disabled.

versions: |
  >= 3.1.0
