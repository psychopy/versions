msg: Editable textbox component {textbox} and keyboard component {keyboard} in the same routine may compete for keypresses

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Textbox and keyboard conflict

synopsis: |
  As editable Textbox components and Keyboard components both listen for key presses, the two can often come into
  conflict and cause problems.

details: |
  As editable Textbox components and Keyboard components both listen for key presses, the two can often come into
  conflict and cause problems. For example, if a Keyboard component is listening for `Enter` to end the routine, what
  happens when the participant presses `Enter` to start a new line?

solutions: |
  In general, we recommend ending routines containing editable textboxes using a Button, Mouse or ROI component rather than
  Keyboard. If you are trying to gather keyboard responses as well as text input, consider splitting the two into
  separate routines to avoid conflicts.
