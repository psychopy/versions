label: Eyetracking not configured

synopsis: |
  Experiment includes components or routines which use eyetracking, but no eye tracker is configured.

details: |
  In order for an Eyetracker Record, Eyetracker Calibrate or Eyetracker Validate routine to work, there needs to be an
  eyetracker set up in Experiment Settings.

solutions: |
  Either remove any eyetracking components and routines from the experiment flow or set up an eyetracker in the
  Eyetracker tab of Experiment Settings. If you are testing an eye tracking experiment but do not have an eye tracker
  connected, you can use MouseGaze to simulate eye movements with the mouse.
