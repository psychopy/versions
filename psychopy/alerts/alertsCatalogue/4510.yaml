label: Eyetracker not calibrated

synopsis: |
  The experiment is set up to use an eye tracker, but there is no calibration routine in the experiment flow.

details: |
  In order to get accurate readings, an eye tracker needs to know what points on the screen correspond to what eye
  movements. It learns this during a "calibration" routine - in which the participant looks at different points on the
  screen whose positions are known to the eye tracker. While an eyetracker can sometimes guess, readings will be much
  more accurate if the eyetracker has been calibrated.

solutions: |
  Either set the `Eyetracker` setting in `Experiment Settings` to be `None` (no eye tracking) or `MouseGaze` (use the
  mouse as if it were an eye tracker) so that no calibration is needed, or add a calibration routine to the experiment
  flow. You can find the button to create a calibration routine in the Eyetracking section of the Components panel and
  can add it to the flow via the Add Routine button.
