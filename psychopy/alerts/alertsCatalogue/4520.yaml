msg: As {brand} eyetrackers do not support animations in their calibration routine, animation
  values have not been used in your calibration routine.

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Animation params not used

synopsis: |
  Some eyetrackers do not support animations between target stimuli in their calibration routine, so although you
  have enabled animation in your calibration routine, due to the limitations of the eyetracker you are using any
  settings for animation will not be used.

details: |


solutions: |
  If you are only using the current eyetracker to test an experiment and will be using one which supports target
  animations, then you don't need to do anything. This alert will stop appearing when you use the other
  eyetracker.

  Otherwise, you just need to be aware that the settings you've specified for animation will not have any effect.
