msg: Eyetrackers by {brand} do not support manual pacing

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Auto pace param not used

synopsis: |
  Some eyetrackers do not support manual pacing for calibration, as pacing is always handled automatically. If you have
  set "Auto-Pacing" to False while using one of these eyetrackers, this setting will be ignored.

details: |


solutions: |
  If you are only using the current eyetracker to test an experiment and will be using one which supports manual pacing,
  then you don't need to do anything. This alert will stop appearing when you use the other eyetracker.

  Otherwise, you just need to be aware that pacing will be automatic.
