label: Eyetracking requires a monitor config

synopsis: |
  In order for eyetracking measurements to be accurate, the eyetracker needs to know about the monitor you are using -
  how wide is it? How tall? What is its resolution? This is so that it can translate eye movements (in degrees of visual
  angle) into usable data (in height, pix, etc. units). Without this information, the eyetracker can only guess and will
  therefore give only approximate data.
