cat: Parameters not used online
msg: Device parameter of microphone component "{name}" will not be used online.

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Microphone device not applicable online

synopsis: |
  A non-default value was given for the "device" parameter of a microphone component, this will not be used when running
  online.

details: |
  When running experiments locally, it is useful to define a specific device for a Microphone component. For example,
  you may want to plug in a microphone to your laptop and tell PsychoPy to use that microphone rather than the one
  built into your laptop. For this reason, you can specify a device for a Microphone component.

  However, when running online, we cannot be sure what microphone devices the participant will have connected. As such,
  the device parameter does not apply to online experiments and will not be used online.

solutions: |
  No action needed. To silence this alert, set the device parameter of the Microphone component to be "default".
