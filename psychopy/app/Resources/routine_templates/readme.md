# Routine templates

These will show up as options that can be added to Experiments using New Routine in 
either the Flow of the Experiment menu.

You can add Routine Templates of your own by adding an experiment file to your PsychoPy
preferences folder, typically:
    - ~/.psychopy3/routine_templates  # on MacOS
    - AppData\Roaming\psychopy3\routine_templates  # on Win10

The name of the experiment file becomes the name of the Category and the name of the
Routine within that file becomes the name of the template.

Have fun making those wacky, reusable templates!
