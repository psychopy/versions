# Changes in 2023.1.0

## Introducing: Plugins
Over the years, PsychoPy has gotten pretty big! We have a lot more functionality than when we 
first started, but with that comes more packages and dependencies. In 2023.1.0 we introduced 
plugins - making certain functinality optional rather than coming with PsychoPy by default. 
Check out the "Plugins & packages manager" in the "Tools" menu to see what's available.
