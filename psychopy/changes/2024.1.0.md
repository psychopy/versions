# Changes in 2024.1.0

## Introducing: Pilot mode
You may have noticed a new toggle button in the Builder toolbar - pressing it changes the run 
buttons from green to orange. This button toggles the new "pilot mode" on and off. When in pilot 
mode, the "Run in JS" button will run your experiment locally in your browser rather than on 
Pavlovia, and the "Run in Python" button will run your experiment with a few (configurable) 
adjustments, most noticeably:
- It will always run in Windowed mode, making it easier to escape if something goes wrong
- It will always run with full logging, so you get the maximum amount of info

To make it extra clear that you are in piloting mode, there's also a pretty noticeable orange 
border around the window, so you don't run on actual participants while in this mode.

The purpose of piloting mode is to give you a safer environment to build your experiment in, 
after which you can switch to running mode when you're ready to start gathering data.
