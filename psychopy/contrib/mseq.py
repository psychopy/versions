Usage:
in a script:
  from psychopy.contrib import mseq
  print(mseq.mseq(2,3,1,1)) # base, power, shift, which-sequence

from command line:
  ./mseq.py 2 3 1 1

%        Maximum length sequence assuming 2,3,5 distinct values
%
%       [ms]=MSEQ(baseVal,powerVal[,shift,whichSeq])
%
%       OUTPUT:
%       ms = generated maximum length sequence, of length basisVal^powerVal-1
%
%       INPUT:
%          baseVal  -nuber of sequence levels (2,3, or 5 allowed)
%          powerVal -power, so that sequence length is baseVal^powerVal-1
%          shift    -cyclical shift of the sequence
%          whichSeq -sequence istantiation to use 
%          (numer of sequences varies with powerVal - see the code)
