def shellCall(shellCmd, stdin='', stderr=False, env=None, encoding=None):
    """Call a single system command with arguments, return its stdout.
    Returns stdout, stderr if stderr is True.
    Handles simple pipes, passing stdin to shellCmd (pipes are untested
    on windows) can accept string or list as the first argument

    Parameters
    ----------
    shellCmd : str, or iterable
        The command to execute, and its respective arguments.

    stdin : str, or None
        Input to pass to the command.

    stderr : bool
        Whether to return the standard error output once execution is finished.

    env : dict
        The environment variables to set during execution.

    encoding : str
        The encoding to use for communication with the executed command.
        This argument will be ignored on Python 2.7.

    Notes
    -----
    We use ``subprocess.Popen`` to execute the command and establish
    `stdin` and `stdout` pipes.
    Python 2.7 always opens the pipes in text mode; however,
    Python 3 defaults to binary mode, unless an encoding is specified.
    To unify pipe communication across Python 2 and 3, we now provide an
    `encoding` parameter, enforcing `utf-8` text mode by default.
    This parameter is present from Python 3.6 onwards; using an older
    Python 3 version will raise an exception. The parameter will be ignored
    when running Python 2.7.
