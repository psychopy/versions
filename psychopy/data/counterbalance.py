    ----------
    shelf : psychopy.data.shelf.Shelf
        Which shelf to draw data from?
    entry : str
        Name of the Shelf entry to use.
    conditions : list[dict]
        List of dicts indicating, for each group:
        - Its name
        - Max number of participants
        - [optional] Additional arbitrary parameters
    nReps : int
        Number of (total) times the slots for each group need to be depleted for the shelf entry
        to be considered "finished". This sets the initial value for `reps` - each time the
        number of slots left for all groups reaches 0, if `reps` is more than 1, the slots are
        refilled and `reps` decreases by 1.
    autoLog : bool
        Whether to print to the log whenever an attribute of this object changes.
