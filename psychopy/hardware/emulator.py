    """Accepts up to four fMRI scan parameters (TR, volumes, sync-key, skip),
    and launches an experiment in one of two modes: Scan, or Test.

    :Usage:
        See Coder Demo -> experiment control -> fMRI_launchScan.py.

        In brief: 1) from psychopy.hardware.emulator import launchScan;
        2) Define your args; and 3) add 'vol = launchScan(args)'
        at the top of your experiment script.

    launchScan() waits for the first sync pulse and then returns, allowing
    your experiment script to proceed. The key feature is that, in test mode,
    it first starts an autonomous thread that emulates sync pulses (i.e.,
    emulated by your CPU rather than generated by an MRI machine). The
    thread places a character in the key buffer, exactly like a keyboard
    event does. launchScan will wait for the first such sync pulse (i.e.,
    character in the key buffer). launchScan returns the number of sync pulses
    detected so far (i.e., 1), so that a script can account for them
    explicitly.

    If a globalClock is given (highly recommended), it is reset to 0.0 when
    the first sync pulse is detected. If a mode was not specified when calling
    launchScan, the operator is prompted to select Scan or Test.

    If **scan mode** is selected, the script will wait until the first scan
    pulse is detected. Typically this would be coming from the scanner, but
    note that it could also be a person manually pressing that key.

    If **test mode** is selected, launchScan() starts a separate thread to
    emit sync pulses / key presses. Note that this thread is effectively
    nothing more than a key-pressing metronome, emitting a key at the start
    of every TR, doing so with high temporal precision.

    If your MR hardware interface does not deliver a key character as a sync
    flag, you can still use launchScan() to test script timing. You have to
    code your experiment to trigger on either a sync character (to test
    timing) or your usual sync flag (for actual scanning).

    :Parameters:
        win: a :class:`~psychopy.visual.Window` object (required)

        settings : a dict containing up to 5 parameters
            (2 required: TR, volumes)

            TR :
                seconds per whole-brain volume (minimum value = 0.1s)
            volumes :
                number of whole-brain (3D) volumes to obtain in a given
                scanning run.
            sync :
                (optional) key for sync timing, default = '5'.
            skip :
                (optional) how many volumes to silently omit initially
                (during T1 stabilization, no sync pulse). default = 0.
            sound :
                (optional) whether to play a sound when simulating scanner
                sync pulses

        globalClock :
            optional but highly recommended :class:`~psychopy.core.Clock` to
            be used during the scan; if one is given, it is reset to 0.000
            when the first sync pulse is received.

        simResponses :
            optional list of tuples [(time, key), (time, key), ...]. time
            values are seconds after the first scan pulse is received.

        esc_key :
            key to be used for user-interrupt during launch.
            default = 'escape'

        mode :
            if mode is 'Test' or 'Scan', launchScan() will start in that mode.

        instr :
            instructions to be displayed to the scan operator during mode
            selection.

        wait_msg :
            message to be displayed to the subject while waiting for the
            scan to start (i.e., after operator indicates start but before
            the first scan pulse is received).

        wait_timeout :
            time in seconds that launchScan will wait before assuming
            something went wrong and exiting. Defaults to 300sec (5 min).
            Raises a RuntimeError if no sync pulse is received in the
            allowable time.
