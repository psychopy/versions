"""Software fMRI machine emulator.

Idea: Run or debug an experiment script using exactly the same code, i.e., for
both testing and online data acquisition. To debug timing, you can emulate sync
pulses and user responses.

Limitations: pyglet only; keyboard events only.

These are optional components that can be obtained by installing the
`psychopy-mri-emulator` extension into the current environment.
