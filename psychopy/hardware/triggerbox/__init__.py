"""Classes and functions for using trigger boxes.

Trigger boxes are used to send electrical signals to external devices. They are
typically used to synchronize the presentation of stimuli with the recording of
physiological data. This module provides a common interface for accessing
trigger boxes from within PsychoPy.

This module serves as the entry point for plugin classes implementing
third-party trigger box interfaces. All installed interfaces are discoverable
by calling the :func:`getAllTriggerBoxes()` function. To have your trigger box
interface discovered by PsychoPy, you need to create a Python module that
defines a class inheriting from :class:`BaseTriggerBox` and set its entry point
to ``psychopy.hardware.triggerbox`` in your plugin setup script or configuration 
file.
