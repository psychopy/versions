    """The EyeTrackerDevice class is the main class for the ioHub Common Eye
    Tracker interface.

    The Common Eye Tracker Interface--a set of common functions and methods
    such that the same experiment script and data analyses can be shared,
    used, and compared regardless of the actual eye tracker used--works by
    extending the EyeTrackerDevice class to configure device monitoring and
    data access to individual eye tracker manufacturers and models.

    Not every EyeTrackerDevice subclass will support all of the umbrella functionality
    within the Common Eye Tracker Interface, but a core set of critical functions are
    supported by all eye tracker models to date. Any Common Eye Tracker Interface
    method not supported by the configured Eye Tracker hardware returns a constant
    (EyeTrackerConstants.FUNCTIONALITY_NOT_SUPPORTED).

    Methods in the EyeTrackerDevice class are broken down into several categories:

    #. Initializing the Eye Tracker / Setting the Device State.
    #. Defining the Graphics Layer for Calibration / System Setup.
    #. Starting and Stopping of Data Recording.
    #. Sending Messages or Codes to Synchronize the ioHub with the Eye Tracker.
    #. Accessing Eye Tracker Data During Recording.
    #. Accessing the Eye Tracker native time base.
    #. Synchronizing the ioHub time base with the Eye Tracker time base

    .. note::

        Only **one** instance of EyeTracker can be created within an experiment.
        Attempting to create > 1 instance will raise an exception.
